# Plan

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a application that helps track different media including TV shows, movies, books and games.

The problems this project is attempting to solve:
- Forgetting what shows I was in the middle of watching.
- Losing track of what books I've completed.
- Remembering recommendations from friends.

## Goals

- Maintain a log of all media.
- Quickly see which items are in progress, completed, or planned.
- Keep data persistent.

## Scope

- Add media entry with title, type, status and other.
- Edit and delete entries.
- Filter by status.
- persistent storage in database.
- Multi-user support.

**Out of Scope**
- Sync between devices.
- Recommendations based on completed media.
- Per episode tracking of TV shows.
